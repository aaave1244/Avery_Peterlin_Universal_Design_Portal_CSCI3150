<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>
    Hi :) my name is Avery Peterlin and I'm a junior in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
    I've never taken a website design class before (It's obvious I know) but I'm passionate about learning more :)
    A secret about me is that there is an instagram account called @larringtonwellingonpeterlin that is pictures of me with a bald filter. 
    I do not run the account, and they claim to be my twin brother who is bald and is named Larrington Wellington Peterlin.
    I'm chill with it thoug because it's hilarious :)
