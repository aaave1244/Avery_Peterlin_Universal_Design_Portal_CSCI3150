            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Iain Armitage, who would play young Jim Parsons in the biopic, was born in 2008. He is best known for his role as Sheldon Cooper in the prequel series Young Sheldon. He is also known for his role as Ziggy Chapman in the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies. We would need to start filming soon, as he is growing up fast. I'll look into it.

            <h2>Late Life</h2>
            <p>
                Bryan Cranston, who would play old Jim Parsons in the biopic, was born in 1956. He is best known for his role as Walter White in the AMC series Breaking Bad. He is also known for his role as Hal in the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle. He is a very talented actor and I think he would be perfect for the role. We just need to predict what Jim Parson's late life will look like, and then it'll be perfect. I'll look into it.
