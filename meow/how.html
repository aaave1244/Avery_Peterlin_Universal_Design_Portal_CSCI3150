                    <h3><b>1.</b> Phone first design </h3><br>
                    Doing website design with phones in mind before anything else is a good way to ensure that your website is accessible to all users. This is because phones are the most common way that people access the internet, and designing with phones in mind first can help you create a more user-friendly experience for everyone. An easy way to design with phones in mind first is to make your standard css code for phones, and doing media queries to resize your page as the screen size increases.<br><br>
                    <h3><b>2.</b> Silktide </h3><br>
                    Run the silktide extension on your website to see how accessible it is!! Silktide is a tool that checks your website for accessibility issues and provides you with a report on how to fix them. This can help you identify areas of your website that may be difficult for users with disabilities to navigate, and make the necessary changes to improve accessibility. We used this a ton in class and it was the best tool I've worked with so far for making my websites more accessible.<br><br>
                    <h3><b>3.</b> Accessible code </h3><br>
                    Use things like alt tags for images, labels, and other accessibility features in your css and HTML! This also means using div as minimally as possible, as divs can be difficult for screen readers to navigate. Instead, use semantic HTML elements like "header", "nav", "main", "section", "article", "aside", and "footer" to create a more accessible website (much like the one I'm making right now!).<br><br>
                    <h3><b>4.</b> Test your website! </h3><br>
                    Besides just running your website through an online checker, you should use your website yourself! Try navigating it with a screen reader, or with the keyboard only. This can help you identify areas of your website that may be difficult for users with disabilities to navigate, and make the necessary changes to improve accessibility. I've sent my projects from this class to my sister a few times to get a second opinion to be able to make my websites better for accessibility!<br><br>
