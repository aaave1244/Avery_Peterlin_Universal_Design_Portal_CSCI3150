                <p>
                    <h3><b>1.</b> Norman's design concepts: </h3><br>
                    What are Norman's design concepts? They are a set of principles that help designers create more user-friendly products. There are 7 principles in total, and they are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Affordances:</b> The elements of an interface that suggest how it should be used. For example, a button on a website should visually indicate it can be clicked.</li>
                        <li><b>Signifiers:</b> Cues that indicate how to use an interface. These include labels, icons, and visual markers.</li>
                        <li><b>Feedback:</b> Provides users with immediate and clear information about the result of their actions. My favorite example of this is haptic feedback.</li>
                        <li><b>Mapping:</b> The relationship between controls and their effects. Good mapping ensures users can predict outcomes intuitively.</li>
                        <li><b>Constraints:</b> Limits the user's actions to prevent errors or confusion. My favorite example of this is when Windows Task Manager was first released, you were allowed to stop the operating system itself, meaning your computer would just crash. Microsoft eventually scaled back its functionality to prevent users from doing this.</li>
                        <li><b>Discoverability:</b> Users can easily figure out how to perform actions or find information.</li>
                        <li><b>Consistency:</b> Design ensures that similar elements behave in predictable ways. For example, the back and forward arrows on your browser.</li>
                    </ul> <br>


                    <h3><b>2.</b> WCAG: </h3><br>
                    WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) is a set of internationally recognized standards created by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure web content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. These guidelines are designed to make websites, applications, and other digital platforms usable for people with diverse needs, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. <br>
                    <ul> <br>
                        <li><b>Perceivable:</b> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>
                        <li><b>Operable:</b> User interface components and navigation must be operable.</li>
                        <li><b>Understandable:</b> Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</li>
                        <li><b>Robust:</b> Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
                    </ul> <br>
                    <h3><b>3.</b> Technology: </h3><br>
                    There are many different technologies that can help users with disabilities access the web. Some examples include screen readers, which read the text on a webpage out loud to the user, and colorblindness simulators, which show users how a webpage might look to someone with colorblindness. I have linked some of these resources as well as WCAG in the Links to resources aside.<br>
