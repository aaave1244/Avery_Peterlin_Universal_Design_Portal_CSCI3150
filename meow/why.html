                <h2>Why</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3><b>1.</b> Why is accessibility important? </h3><br>
                    Accessibility is important because it ensures that everyone, regardless of ability, can access and use the web. This is especially important for people with disabilities, who may rely on assistive technologies to navigate the web. By designing websites with accessibility in mind, you can create a more inclusive and equitable online experience for all users. I believe that as a web designer, you have an ethical responsibility to make your content available to anyone who may want to view it.<br> <br>
                    <h3><b>2.</b> Diversity and equity in website design </h3><br>
                    Having an accessible website is not only the right thing to do, but it also makes good business sense. By designing websites that are accessible to all users, you can reach a wider audience and improve the user experience for everyone. In addition, accessible websites are more likely to be ranked higher in search engine results, which can help drive traffic to your site. <br> <br>
                    <h3><b>3.</b> My personal connection to accessible web design, my sister </h3><br>
                    My sister is legally blind, and she sometimes relies on screen readers to navigate the web. She has shared with me how frustrating it can be to encounter websites that are not accessible (mainly her university's website, she has to get her roomates to navigate it for her), and how much of a difference it makes when a website is designed with accessibility in mind. Her experiences have inspired me to learn more about web accessibility, and to advocate for more inclusive design practices in the future! <br> <br>
                    I also wanted to include a picture of her from when she was younger and had to use a magnifying glass to be able to read the words on her computer screen but she wouldn't let me <br>
